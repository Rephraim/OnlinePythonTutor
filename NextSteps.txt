Some work left to be done:

Compatibility testing:
  -Browsers (I doubt there will be issues, but might be prudent to check other browsers. Our team mostly used Chrome for testing.)
  -Screen Readers (Check using other popular screen readers (JAWS, VoiceOver, etc.). Our team used NVDA)
  
User Testing and Feedback

Possible Extra Features:

  Compatibility with collaborative mode
